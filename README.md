# ENG-220---team-----project

Abstract:
Healthcare in the United States has long been a contentious topic. According to the Commonwealth Fund, the US ranks last in terms of healthcare affordability. The common remedy to that problem is insurance; however, the coverage of these plans can vary from state to state. Sudden injuries and medical emergencies can completely alter the course of our lives. Many people across the country live paycheck to paycheck and cannot afford the added debt caused by these sudden, uncontrollable emergencies. Our goal with this project is to shed light on the situation: the dataset we used compiles health coverage across the United States, as well as New Mexico. To address this pressing issue every American citizen is facing, we must clearly recognize the large amount of empirical data behind it. The first step towards the solution of a problem is laying out a framework that is digestible. By shedding light upon the severity of this crisis, including the high rate of uninsurance and the inadequacy of underinsurance that leaves workers and families vulnerable, we aim to quantify the human cost of the current system.

Conclusion:
From this project, we have establised a GitHub repository that we can use to organize programs in our project. Additionally, all group members are now aware of how to commit/push changes to a GitHub repository. We've succesfully divided each important task amongst our group members for efficiency and transparency.
